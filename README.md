## Scripts

### Wanikani: Total progress

This is a re-implementation of [total progress bar (2cool4progress)](https://community.wanikani.com/t/userscript-total-progress-bar-allows-level-progress-removalaka-2cool4progress/38899) using modern js.
The motivation behind this re-implementation was to add a few features and at the same time, attempt to increase load speed and decrease the amount of code.

### Wanikani: Levels completed per SRS

This is a re-implementation of [levels by srs](https://community.wanikani.com/t/userscript-levels-by-srs/37711) using modern js.
The motivation behind this re-implementation was to inline the display into the list elements displaying the amount of items on each stage.
